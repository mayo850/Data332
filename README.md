# Data332


# Final Project

This final assignment consists of two final projects; 
1) Project-Insect Carnivore
2) Cabbage Butterfly

## Description

Raw data was provided in the form of .csv and .xlsx, the contributers used R Studio to clean the data and answer different questions. Exploratory Data Analysis was the key. The basic goal of EDA is to assist in the analysis of data before making any assumptions. It can aid in the detection of evident errors, as well as a better understanding of data patterns, the detection of outliers or unusual events, and the discovery of interesting relationships between variables. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* R or R Studio the collaborators of this project specifically used R Studio.
* Collaborator who worked on the Ladybug project used a Mac.

### Installing

* https://www.rstudio.com/
* Download R Studio from the aforementioned website.

### Executing program

Just download the library mentioned and run the program, it's as simple as that.

VISUALIZATIONS FOR BUTTERFLY DATASET

Line chart showing Maximum RW length by years:

We decided to use line chart for max RW length by years because we had alot of values so, it wouldn't be suitable to use other form of charts or graph.
We wanted to track the small changes over short period of time which is easier to show in line chart. Moreover, last 75 years is a good amount of time to
check max RW length. We found out that the max RW length has decreased compared to 1950s

Graph showing mean of LW Apex by country:

Our group was curious to see what affect does location have on butterflies so we made bar graph of mean of LW apex by country to see that. 
We found out from the graph that the countries that have high temps with alot of rain have high avg of LW apex. This could be because it is 
hard for butterflies to survive in cold weather.

Graph showing mean of LW width by gender:

Our group was curious to see how does gender affect characteristics of a butterfly so we made bar graph of mean of
LW width by gender to see that. The graph showed that female have high mean LW width compared to male this could be because females have to 
take care of their babies so they use their long wings to protect them.
