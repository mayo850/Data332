## Description

Raw data was provided in the form of .csv and .xlsx, the contributers used R Studio to clean the data and answer different questions. Exploratory Data Analysis was the key. The basic goal of EDA is to assist in the analysis of data before making any assumptions. It can aid in the detection of evident errors, as well as a better understanding of data patterns, the detection of outliers or unusual events, and the discovery of interesting relationships between variables.
